# Tutorial, part 7: Managing your own I/O

In this section, you'll take a step back and learn how to use more of Dagster's versatility without using every available feature. Throughout this tutorial, you've learned multiple Dagster concepts that explain how Dagster can manage functionality on your behalf, e.g. I/O managers to read and write from storage.

When building the dictionary of word counts, the `most_frequent_words` asset currently uses a static list of stop words to decide what words to ignore. You’ll notice that despite the length of the list, many unhelpful words and prepositions aren't filtered out. You’d like to ignore those words. To scale this properly, you’ll download a CSV of stop words from the internet, include it in `most_frequent_words`, and update it before the refresh to ensure that the stop words list is up-to-date.

In this section, you'll create assets to manage reading and writing from storage on your own. This is useful for multiple purposes, such as:

- Your pipeline manages I/O on its own by using other libraries/tools that write to storage.
- You want to run a SQL query that creates or updates a table on the database.
- Adjacent to the above point, the data loaded would not fit into memory.
- Writing your pipeline using I/O managers is possible, but you don't want to use this Dagster-specific concept. For example, you have an existing pipeline and don't want to refactor it.

By the end of this section, you'll also have assets that depend on other assets without loading the dependent asset's data into memory.

## Step 1: Creating an asset without an I/O manager

Many valid situations exist where you would want to avoid using an I/O manager to write an asset back to memory. One of these situations is downloading a file from the internet. Because the file is downloaded directly onto the machine rather than loading into memory and returning it, it's unnecessary to use an I/O manager to write the data back to storage.

In `assets.py`, create a new asset called `stopwords_zip` by copying and pasting the code below:

```python file=/tutorial/managing_your_own_io/assets.py startafter=start_stopwords_zip endbefore=end_stopwords_zip
import urllib.request  # Addition: new import at the top of `assets.py`

from dagster import asset


@asset
def stopwords_zip() -> None:
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(
        "https://docs.dagster.io/assets/stopwords.zip",
        "data/stopwords.zip",
    )
```

This asset downloads a file from the internet, where Dagster stores it on the same machine it's running on. There are two key differences between the assets you’ve written so far and this asset:

- **It doesn't have a return statement.** Because the zip file is downloaded directly onto the machine, there is no need to return data.
- **It has a `None` annotation for its return type.** This tells Dagster that it shouldn’t use an I/O manager because there is no data to write back.

These are the only two changes required to have an asset not use an I/O manager.

In the Dagster UI, refresh your code location, observe the new asset, and materialize it as you have with the previous assets. Confirm that this works by locating the `stopwords.zip` in the `/data` directory made in the [Saving your data section of the tutorial](/tutorial/saving-your-data).

## Step 2: Depending on an asset without loading it

By default, an asset loads its dependencies into memory when it materializes. However, there are situations where you would want to avoid doing this. If you're operating directly on data in storage, such as unzipping a zip file, you don't need to load the data into memory.

To tell an asset not to load a dependency into memory when materializing, you can use the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator’s `deps` parameter to establish the dependency instead of including it as an argument of the asset’s function definition.

Copy the code below into `assets.py` to create a new asset called `stopwords_csv`:

```python file=/tutorial/managing_your_own_io/assets.py startafter=start_stopwords_csv endbefore=end_stopwords_csv
import zipfile  # Note: remember to add imports to the top of the file


@asset(deps=[stopwords_zip])
def stopwords_csv() -> None:
    with zipfile.ZipFile("data/stopwords.zip", "r") as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall("data")
```

In the Dagster UI, reload your code location, observe the new `stopwords_csv` asset, and take note of how it depends on the `stopwords_zip` asset.

---

## Step 3: Combining assets with and without I/O managers

Now that you’ve made two assets that don’t use I/O managers, you’ll connect the `stopwords_csv` asset to your `most_frequent_words` asset to use a more comprehensive list of stop words.

When defining an asset, you can combine assets that use I/O managers with assets that don’t. Using the following code, update your `most_frequent_words` asset to use `stopwords_csv` instead of a static list of stop words:

```python file=/tutorial/managing_your_own_io/assets.py startafter=start_updated_most_frequent_words endbefore=end_updated_most_frequent_words
import csv  # Note: Remember to add all new imports to the top


@asset(
    deps=[stopwords_csv],  # Addition: added the dependency
)
def most_frequent_words(topstories):
    # stopwords = ["a", "the", "an", "of", "to", "in", "for", "and", "with", "on", "is"]
    # Remove the line above

    # Replace the with the two lines below
    with open("data/stopwords.csv", "r") as f:
        stopwords = {row[0] for row in csv.reader(f)}

    # ...

    # Keep the rest of the function the same
```

To validate that this worked, navigate to the Dagster UI and materialize the entire asset graph to see the dependency between `most_frequent_words` and `stopwords_csv`.

## Next steps

In this section, you learned how to create assets without an I/O manager and define them as dependencies on other assets. You also learned how to combine assets that use I/O managers with assets that don't.

Next, you'll learn how to build more robustness, reusability, and flexibility when [connecting to external services](/tutorial/connecting-to-external-services) by using resources.
